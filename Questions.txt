1. Sequential() vs Functional() API? Do we need attributes of the Functional() API to improve performance?

2. How do values given for the filters, kernel_size, strides, etc. affect the performance of the model?

3. How do we choose the number of nodes to use for the Dense layer?

4. Would it be good to use a Dropout layer to improve performance by reducing overfitting?
